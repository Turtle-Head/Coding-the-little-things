	<h3>Tings I think about</h3>
  So I have been thinking about a lot of things. I hink about my 3 lovely boys. I think about where I live and how I don't ike where I live. I think about how many jobs I've applied for and not been given. I think about working out and the 6 pack I am working on. I think about how much I want to get a 3rd degree as a Full Stack Web Developer and I think about what it will take to get me there. I think about Kickboxing and how much I want to do it. I think abot love and how much I want a girlfriend to spend my life with. I think about the divorce I am going through, and it is taking a long time to get it. I think about my Diabetes which I have had for over 20 years and how better to control it. My life in in disarray and needs cleaning up. I need to quit smoking which I recently stated after not smoking for 4 months, which was a bad decision on my part.
