<h3>Things I think about</h3>
I have noticed lately that peope are often being silly about the way they treat
each other and with the new year we all have the oportunity that we need to do
something about it.

<br/>
  I think about Kickboxing and how much I want to do it. I
think abot love and how much I want a girlfriend to spend my life with. I think
about the divorce I am going through, and it is taking a long time to get it. I
think about my Diabetes which I have had for over 20 years and how better to
control it. My life in in disarray and needs cleaning up. I need to quit smoking
which I recently stated after not smoking for 4 months, which was a bad decision
on my part.

	<h3>Tings I think about</h3>
  So I have been thinking about a lot of things. I think about my 3 lovely boys. I think about the websites I build and how to improve them. I spend a lot of time thinking aboout the games I play. Recently I bought Fallout New Vegas... and I am not even taking the time to enjoy it. I like playing Skyrim but I haven't even been spending anytime playing that either. The one that has always captured my attention is Eve Online which I play religiously. Yesterday I had too much free time so I spent the better part of the afternoon and into the evening mining for ore that I will be using to build spaceships to get them blown up which makes me very happy.

	This is one of my adventures in Eve: https://youtu.be/xqAnBiiGKu0 it was when I came back to the game after a month away from it.
