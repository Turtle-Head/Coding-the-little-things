  <h3>Things I think about</h3>
<p>The world is cruel, but we don't need to be cruel to live in it. I encourage being kind to others and helping those who need it.</p>
<br>
<p> Many people are looking for good programmers, evident from what I have seen on industry websites. Landing work, though, can be difficult, as more than a few recruits are being ignored by ATS or discarded as not a right fit by recruiters. I am willing and able to work on new projects and have continued refining my skills. I would love to join you and create something magical with your company. Don't hesitate to let me know if you are interested in seeing how I can fit with your development team.</p>
