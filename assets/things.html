<h3>Things I think about</h3>
I have noticed lately that peope are often being silly about the way they treat
each other and with the new year we all have the oportunity that we need to do
something about it.

  I think about Kickboxing and how much I want to do it. I
think abot love and how much I want a girlfriend to spend my life with. I think
about the divorce I am going through, and it is taking a long time to get it. I
think about my Diabetes which I have had for over 20 years and how better to
control it. My life in in disarray and needs cleaning up. I need to quit smoking
which I recently stated after not smoking for 4 months, which was a bad decision
on my part.
