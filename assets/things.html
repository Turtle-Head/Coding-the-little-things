<h3>Things I think about</h3>
I have noticed lately that people are often being silly about the way they treat
each other and with the new year we all have the oportunity that we need to do
something about it.

  Lately while in class I have been thinking that if I can just learn a little more I will be able to get ahead of the crowd of people doing what I love doing and doing it well. I have also been considering learning how to use "React.js" and I have found a how to learn site here at <a href src="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#learn-react">Learn React.</a> I have hopes to begin converting sites as soon as I have a handle on the framework, which if I add into existing projects, should be rather simple...i hope.
