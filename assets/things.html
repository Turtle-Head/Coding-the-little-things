  <h2>Things I think about</h2>
<h3>The world is cruel</h3><p> We don't need to be cruel to live in it. I encourage being kind to others and helping those who need it.</p>
<br>
<h4>Looking to make a difference</h4>
<p> Many people are looking for good programmers, evident from what I have seen on industry websites. If you are one of those people, I am willing and able to work on new projects and have continued refining my skills. I would love to join you and create something magical with your company. Don't hesitate to let me know if you are interested in seeing how I can fit with your development team.</p>
<br>
