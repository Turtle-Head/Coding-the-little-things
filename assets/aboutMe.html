	<h3>A little bit about me</h3>
	<p> I am a programmer who enjoys new challenges. Continually refining my skills in this fast-paced technology boom. With 7+ years of experience coding websites and other things like scripts and video games, I strive to be efficient and love to learn better ways to implement new things. </p>
<p>Recently, I have delved into understanding SQL and NoSQL server use and Python and how to create apps using it. If you are interested in what I can do, please check out my <a href="https://turtle-head.github.io/PortfolioDeux/>PortfolioDeux</a>, which lists my current skills and links to my projects.</p>
	<h3>Happy coding!<br>James Fehr<br></h3>
