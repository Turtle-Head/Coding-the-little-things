	<h3>A little bit about me</h3>
	I have been working on and with computers since the age of 10. My first experience was at school (grade 3), where I learned how to make simple programs using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard" target="_blank">Apple's Hypercard</a>. It sparked a huge desire to get into what is now a much more sophisticated and involved way of generating content on computers.<br>
	I enrolled in the Front End Nanodegree program at <a href="udacity.com">Udacity</a> and spent 6 months learning the intricaies of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, and can finally say I have graduated. I can't say it wasn't a struggle at times to get things to work, trial and error were my best friends and still are, but I believe that this is a great way to learn. If you are looking for a great place to learn how to code check them out.<br>
	When I am not at my computer you can usually find me with a book in hand somewhere quiet enjoying myself, or to listening to music. If you want to reach me for a project or something else go ahead and send me an email.<br>
	<h3>Happy coding!<br>James Fehr<br></h3>
